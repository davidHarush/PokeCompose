# PokeCompose

Jetpack Compose </br>
Single-Activity, no Fragments.


PokeCompose is a mobile app built using Jetpack Compose</br>
With a single-activity architecture and no fragments. </br>
This is my first Compose app, and I had a lot of fun building it.</br>
After using Compose, I don't think I could go back to the traditional XML technique.</br>

The goal of this project was to experiment with Compose, add some animations, and learn.</br>
I'm sharing this repo as a template that can be used as a foundation for future projects.

Have fun exploring and experimenting with PokeCompose!
